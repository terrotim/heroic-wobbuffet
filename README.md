## GC Simulation
Simulates 10000 rounds of Grand Conquest, given the controlled nodes and the edges available, and generates the average number of nodes controlled by each team at the end.


### New:
Given a screenshot of the map, generates a heatmap of each node to display what teams tend to control it.
